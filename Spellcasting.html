		<h1>Spellcasting</h1>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Spellcasting is the process of converting mana into desired effects. It is often used as a direct replacement for technological solutions to problems, leading societies with greater spellcasting ability to have a slower technological development.</p>
		<h2>Mana Sources</h2>
		<h3>Souls</h3>
		<p>Every creature has a soul. A soul produces mana until the space around it is saturated, where the specific amount that constitutes as saturated varies by individual and bloodline. The collection of mana around the soul is often referred to as a mana pool, since it can be drawn upon for spellcasting. Unlike other mana pools, soul pools contain an infinite supply of mana and are only limited by how much mana can be used over a specific duration.</p>
		<h3>Manzite</h3>
		<p>Manzite is a naturally occurring substance that contains mana. Mana can be extracted from manzite by one of two methods and used to cast spells. The first method requires heating the manzite until it is molten or gaseous before using an initial supply of mana to trigger a self-sustaining extraction spell. The second method requires ionizing the manzite and colliding it at high-speed with another solid, which ejects the mana from the manzite without the need for an extraction spell.</p>
		<h3>Environmental</h3>
		<p>Mana can be found in the environment under special circumstances, such as when stored mana is released or after the processes of ionizing manzite. Although mana does not occur naturally in the material plane, the dream plane contains excess mana that can be drawn upon when projecting into it.</p>
		<h2>Conversion</h2>
		<h3>Intention</h3>
		<p>Intention is the easiest form of conversion to use, as it does not require knowing a special casting language. Intention only requires that the caster be able to focus on the desired effects, at the cost of expending additional mana to allow the spell itself to determine the meaning of the intent. Intention can cause problems for the caster if they are unable to focus properly, causing their spells to fail or even misinterpret their intetion.</p>
		<h3>Invocation</h3>
		<p>Invocation was created to solve the problems associated with intention. By replacing thoughts with words spoken out loud, the caster is able to define rules that constrain what the spell can and can not do. This reduces the likelyhood of misinterpretation as well as completely avoiding the additional overhead involved with intention. Although invocation can theoretically be done in any language, it can be extremely time consuming if the language was not specifically designed with spellcasting in mind.</p>
		<h3>Notation</h3>
		<p>Notation was created as a means to create spells with complexity that exceeded the practical limits of an invocation. Notation has the benefit of being easily corrected by writing utensils before being cast, unlike intention and invocation which require adding corrections to the spell at the cost of mana. Notation is the slowest form of conversion for living creatures, but machines can significantly increase the speed that notation can be created and cast at.</p>
		<h3>Stored</h3>
		<p>A stored spell is capable of triggering its effects after arbitrary conditions are met. They do not require a spellcaster to be present because the spell itself retains the required mana. A stored spell can only be created by first using one of the other forms of conversion.</p>
		<h2>Effects</h2>
		<h3>Aspect</h3>
		<p>Aspects are ranges of effects that are grouped by which parts of the world they interact with.</p>

		<h3>Technique</h3>
		<p>Techniques describe how the aspects of a spell are applied to the world.</p>
		<h4>Perception</h4>
		<p>Perception is the weakest technique and allows the caster to falsify the desired effects. The mana consumed by this technique is 500 M&#776;.</p>
		<h4>Control</h4>
		<p>Control allows the caster to manipulate an aspect to an extent that does not go beyond the limits of the aspects natural behaviour. The mana consumed by this technique is 1500 M&#776;.</p>
		<h4>Transformation</h4>
		<p>Transformation allows the caster to change the attributes of an aspect beyond its natural behaviour. The mana consumed by this technique is 2500 M&#776;.</p>
		<h4>Existence</h4>
		<p>Existence is the strongest technique and allows the caster to create or destroy an aspect. The mana consumed by this technique is 3500 M&#776;.</p>
		<h3>Metamagic</h3>
		<p>Metamagic can be added to any spell to alter how the spell as a whole is applied to the world.</p>
		<h4>Target</h4>
		<p>A target is a creature, object, or space that a spell's effects will directly apply to. The mana consumed by a spell is the product of the mana consumed by its effects and the number of targets it has. Mana is also consumed for the volume of each target, which is equal to 1k M&#776; per cubic meter.</p>
		<h4>Counter</h4>
		<p>A counter prevents another effect from occurring. The mana consumed by a counter is equal to the mana used by the countered spell.</p>
		<h4>Store</h4>
		<p>Mana can be stored within a target and released later. The mana consumed to initiate the storage is 1k M&#776;.</p>
		<h4>Correction</h4>
		<p>Mistakes can be made when casting a spell, such as a wayward thought during an intention or a stutter during an invocation. The cost of issuing a correction is 100 M&#776;.</p>
