		<h2>Use in Nature</h2>
		<h3>Dreaming</h3>
		<p>All sentient creatures have evolved to project their soul into the Unreal during the apex of their sleep cycle. This allows their soul to lower its energy consumtion by augmenting its mana production with mana from the Unreal.</p>
		<h3>Dream Serpents</h3>
		<p>Dream serpents are carnivorous snake-like creatures that are capable of partially projecting their body into the Unreal, rendering them invisible to those who are not also projecting. Smaller species of serpent will inject paralyzing venom into their sleeping prey while the largest will consume their prey whole.</p>
		<h2>Use in Spellcasting</h2>
		<h3>Conjuration</h3>
		<p>Conjuration draws mana from the Unreal and shapes it into physical objects. See <a href="./Spellcasting.html">Spellcasting</a> for more information.</p>
		<h3>Hide Objects</h3>
		<p>Objects can be magically hidden by partially projecting them into the Unreal, a methodology inspired by dream serpents.</p>
