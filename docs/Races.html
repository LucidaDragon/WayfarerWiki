			<p>The aarakocra are a race of bird-like creatures. They have a balanced mix of magic and technological development that has allowed them to construct stellar sailing ships. When combined with their central position in the solar winds, this made them well-suited for building an extensive trade network between the other races, where long-haul cargo could simply glide to its destination instead of requiring excessive amounts of fuel.</p>

		<h2>Crytol</h2>

			<p>The crytol are a race of mantis-like creatures that can cast powerful elemental magic. They are known for arranging themselves into colonies based on elemental groups with one or more queens in control. They are the only race that has not developed faster-than-light travel, instead prefering to ecoform and colonize asteroids and ride them between systems. Due to their powerful magic and lack of technology, the crytol are often considered both primitive and enigmatic by the other races.</p>

		<h2>Human</h2>

			<p>The humans are the oldest of the major races. Evidence of humanity's former influence over the stars has been found on almost every celestial body. Despite this, only a few thousand humans are known to exist in the modern day, living in the City of a Thousand Constructs. The majority of humanity's influence on the cosmos now only exists in the form of automations, which devour asteroid belts and raze planets in search of manzite to fuel the city's machinations.</p>

		<h2>Kobold</h2>
		<div>
			<table class="right">
				<tr>
					<th colspan="2">
						Kobold

				<tr>
					<th>Height</th>

					<th>Life Expectancy</th>
					<td>100 years</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Max Mana</th>
					<td>1k M&#776;</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The kobolds are a race of lizard-like creatures. They are limited in their magic ability compared to the rest of the major races, but they make up for their magical deficiency with their advanced science and technologies that are on par with the machinations of humanity in complexity. The kobolds first became interstellar after the machinations attempted to invade their home system, which became a stimulus for their rapid expansion and innovation.</p>

		<h2>Tabaxi</h2>
		<div>
			<table class="right">
				<tr>
					<th colspan="2">
						Tabaxi

				<tr>
					<th>Size</th>
					<td>170 cm</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Life Expectancy</th>
					<td>150 years</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Max Mana</th>
					<td>7k M&#776;</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The tabaxi are a race of cat-like creatures that are formidable spellcasters. Their spellcasting ability comes at the expense of their technological progression, which has only reached the age of steam. Tabaxi can turn other races into half-tabaxi by biting them, which has led to hostilities between them and the other races inspite of their broader intentions of cooperation.</p>
