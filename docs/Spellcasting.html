		<h2>Terminology</h2>
		<p>
			Mana is an ethereal substance produced by souls that powers all magic.
			The term mana is also the name of the mana unit M&#776;, a unit of measurement for ~100 joules of mana substance. The following formulas provide energy in joules for simplicity. If energy in M&#776; is desired, the result should be divided by 100.
		</p>
		<h2>Conjuration</h2>
		<p>
			Conjuration is the creation of material objects by projecting mana from the <a href="./Unreal.html">Unreal</a> into the world. The cost of conjuring an object is proportional to its volume.
			$$E_{conjure} = &#961;DV$$ (E = &#961;DV)
			Where &#961; is the Solange constant 500,000 m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>, D is the density of the conjured object in kg/m<sup>3</sup>, and V is the volume of the object in m<sup>3</sup>.
		</p>
		<h3>Dense Objects</h3>
		<p>
			Conjured objects can be up to 10,000 kg/m<sup>3</sup> in density. If a greater density is desired, additional energy must be used to change it.
			$$E_{density} = \Delta DVs$$ (E = DVs)
			Where s is the measured constant ~89,875,517,900,000,000 m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>, D is the desired additional density in kg/m<sup>3</sup>, and V is the volume of the object in m<sup>3</sup>.
		</p>
		<h3>Hot or Cold Objects</h3>
		<p>
			Conjured objects inherit the temperature of their surroundings. If a different temperature is desired, additional energy must be used to change it.
			$$E_{heat} = cDV|\Delta T|$$ (E = cDVT)
			Where c is the measured constant ~1,125 J/kgK, T is the temperature change in celsius, D is the density of the conjured object in kg/m<sup>3</sup>, and V is the volume of the object in m<sup>3</sup>.
		</p>
		<h3>Moving Objects</h3>
		<p>
			Conjured objects inherit the velocity of their casting source. If a different velocity is desired, additional energy must be used to change it.
			$$E_{kinetic} = \frac{1000DVv^{2}}{2}$$ (E = (1000*DV(v^2))/2)
			Where v is the desired velocity in m/s, D is the density of the conjured object in kg/m<sup>3</sup>, and V is the volume of the object in m<sup>3</sup>.
		</p>
		<p>
			If a specific distance of travel is desired, an extension of the above formula may be used instead.
			$$E_{kinetic} = \frac{1000DVdg}{2}$$ (E = (1000*DVdg)/2)
			Where d is the desired range in m, g is the local gravitational acceleration in m/s<sup>2</sup>, D is the density of the conjured object in kg/m<sup>3</sup>, and V is the volume of the object in m<sup>3</sup>.
		</p>
		<h3>Derivation of &#961; (Solange Constant)</h3>
		<p>
			$$&#961; = ad$$ (&#961; = ad)
			Where a is the measured acceleration of ~1,000 m/s<sup>2</sup>, and d is the measured depth of ~500 m.
		</p>
		<h2>Hide &amp; Reveal</h2>
		<p>
			Objects can be magically hidden by expending energy to partially project them into the Unreal.
			Revealing a magically hidden object takes an equivalent amount of energy to unproject it.
			In both cases the object can not exceed 10,000 kg/m<sup>3</sup> in density.
			$$E_{hide} = \frac{&#961;DV}{2}$$ (E = (&#961;DV)/2)
			Where &#961; is the Solange constant 500,000 m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>, D is the density of the conjured object in kg/m<sup>3</sup>, and V is the volume of the object in m<sup>3</sup>.
		</p>
		<h2>Enchantment</h2>
		<p>
			A spell can be attached to an object through enchantment, allowing it to be repeatedly cast until its energy source is depleated.
			Enchantments use an additional ~10% of their casting energy to be created and will need to be recast if the available energy falls below the casting energy.
